# Shortcut Hooks

A user's Valora wallet invokes shortcut hooks when determining asset
or dapp related calls-to-action for the user. For example, when a user
opens Valora's homescreen. A shortcut hook returns a human readable
summary of available actions (_e.g._, "Claim your 1 cUSD earnings")
and if the user chooses to act on them a set of blockchain or in-app
transactions that Valora executes with the user's consent.
