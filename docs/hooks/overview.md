# Extend Valora using Hooks

> Valora Hooks are in-development and not fully supported yet!

Valora Hooks is a system that allows developers to extend Valora by
writing short programs called "hooks". Valora will call hooks in
response to certain in-app or blockchain events and use the results
from hooks to extend Valora's functionality.

Valora Hooks is currently an experimental feature in Valora. We are
developing the Valora Hooks system incrementally based on feedback
from developers. Eventually we hope developers will be able to publish
hooks that users can enable or disable at will.

## Example: position pricing

Users often hold asset-like positions with dapps that are specific to
the dapp implementation. For example, DeFi dapps
implement yield farms with smart contracts specific to the dapp and
these contracts track each users' state in the yield farm, like
liquidity and unclaimed rewards. A developer can implement a Valora
hook to detect these types of positions and price them. If a user is
yield farming they will see their yield farm positions directly in
Valora.

## Developing a hook

A developer can write a short TypeScript program that handle a
specific hook type. A user's Valora wallet passes information to the
hook, the hook executes in an isolated environment and returns a
result, and Valora uses the results to extend it's default behavior.

Currently all hooks need to be approved by a Valora engineer before
being available to users in the Valora wallet. Please contact us if
you're interested in developing a hook and haven't chatted with us
yet.

## Hook types

Valora supports or is working on support for the types of hooks we
list below:

- Position pricing: show a custom contract position in Valora
- Name resolution: map an arbitrary identifier or name to a wallet address
- Shortcut (coming soon): complete simple dapp (or inter-dapp) actions
  within Valora

We plan on adding support for more hook types. If you have a request
please reach out on Discord.
