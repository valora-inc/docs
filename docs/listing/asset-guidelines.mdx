# Asset listing guidelines

Our asset listing process focuses on safeguarding users against rug
pulls and other negatively impactful events. We put a lot of trust in
our dapps but must all adhere to specific reviews for everyoneâ€™s
safety and security. Valora may decide to delist any asset we suspect
may be involved in malicious activity.

We have some necessary requirements:

1. Assets must be reviewed and approved by at least one partner
   organization such as known DEXes, NFT marketplaces, blockchain
   foundation program, etc.
2. Enabling an asset as a gas fee currency requires the asset to have
   a price listed on one of our pricing providers (currently
   GeckoTerminal, see [how to list your
   token](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/22611965649305-How-do-I-list-my-token-on-GeckoTerminal-))
   .

Anyone can submit a listing for review by following [these
instructions](https://github.com/valora-inc/address-metadata#adding-new-erc20-tokens).
