# Asset listing guidelines

Our asset listing process focuses on safeguarding users against rug
pulls and other negatively impactful events. We put a lot of trust in
our dapps but must all adhere to specific reviews for everyoneâ€™s
safety and security. Valora may decide to delist any asset we suspect
may be involved in malicious activity.

1. Assets must be reviewed and approved by at least one partner
   organization such as known DEXes, NFT marketplaces, Celo Foundation
   program, etc., or
2. Assets that are natively supported and eligible for CELO-specific
   programs or infrastructure requirements.
