# Dapp listing guidelines

With the Dapps Page, we strive to take our users on a journey to
discover projects built by the Celo community. We also want to ensure
that our users always have safe and delightful experience when
interacting with dapps in Valora.

Please keep in mind that submitting your dapp for review does not
guarantee listing on Valora's Dapps Page. We have put together
guidelines you can follow to ensure your project is in compliance with
Valora's requirements for listing. Following these criteria will
significantly increase your chances to get listed:

1. Easily connects to Valora – First and foremost, your project
   requires connecting to the wallet, it must connect to Valora
   seamlessly. To achieve that, your dapp must support WalletConnect
   V1. Our recommendation is to use the latest version of
   [react-celo](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo).
2. Optimized for mobile – Valora is an app for users who use phones as
   their primary and often only way to interact with the digital
   world. This means that your dapp must present a delightful user
   experience on mobile devices.
3. App store compliant – Since users get Valora through either the
   [Google Play
   Store](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/) or
   the [Apple App
   Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/),
   the dapp must also comply with each of the stores' guidelines
   (linked above).
4. Provide user documentation - Valora will not be responsible for
   supporting users with questions about your dapp. Be sure to provide
   your own support contact, Discord channel, FAQs, user docs, etc.

If your dapp doesn’t meet these initial requirements, it cannot be
listed in Valora's Dapps Page. Additionally Valora may:

- Request proof that the dapp’s contracts are audited by a reputable
  third party.
- Check which integrations are anonymized and which are not.

The Valora team reserves the right to delist any dapp they find does
not adhere to the above requirements or raises separate concerns, such
as regulatory and legal compliance.

Please consider including a user-guide on how to get started with your
dapp. We have summarized [Best Practices for User
Documentation](user-documentation-best-practices) to help dapps author
user guides that we think will be effective.
