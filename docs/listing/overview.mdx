# Overview

Do you want to include your dapp on our Valora Dapps Page to showcase it in front of hundreds of thousands of mobile users worldwide?

Valora submissions are typically reviewed on the following:

1. Dapp listing guidelines – Make sure your dapp complies with the
   [listing guidelines](dapp-guidelines). If you are interested in
   chatting with our team about your launch plans for your dapp while
   you're building it, please reach out to
   [partnerships@valoraapp.com](mailto:partnerships@valoraapp.com). When
   you are ready, please follow [these instructions](adding-new-dapps) on our Github to
   submit a PR\*.
2. ERC-20 asset listing guidelines – If your dapp has its own ERC-20
   asset associated with it, check the [requirements](asset-guidelines) for assets to be
   supported in Valora. To list an asset, please follow [these
   instructions](https://github.com/valora-inc/address-metadata#adding-new-erc20-tokens)
   on our Github to submit a PR\*.
3. ERC-721 asset listing guidelines - If your dapp has ERC-721 assets
   associated with it, check the [requirements](asset-guidelines) for assets to be
   supported in Valora. To add your ERC-721 asset, please follow the
   instructions for [adding new ERC-721 contracts](adding-new-erc721-contracts).

Our team will review your submission, this process might take up to 5
business days. For us at Valora, the safety and convenience of our
users are of paramount importance. The Valora team manually reviews
each submission and only approves projects that adhere to our security
and UX standards.

Please keep in mind that submitting a PR doesn’t guarantee that your
dapp or asset will be listed. If you have any technical questions,
feel free to reach out to our team on [#dapp-dev](https://discord.com/channels/886972503560433675/887422238071087154).
